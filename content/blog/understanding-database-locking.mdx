## Introduction

Concurrency control is one of the most challenging aspects of database management. When multiple transactions attempt to access and modify the same data simultaneously, we need mechanisms to ensure data integrity.

## Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Locking

### 1. Pessimistic Locking
Pessimistic locking assumes that conflict is likely and prevents it by locking the resource as soon as it's accessed.

### 2. Optimistic Locking
Optimistic locking assumes that conflicts are rare. It allows multiple transactions to proceed and only checks for a conflict when the data is being committed.
