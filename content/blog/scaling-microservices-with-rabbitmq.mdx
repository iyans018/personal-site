## Why Use a Message Queue?

Direct service-to-service communication (HTPP/gRPC) can lead to tight coupling and cascading failures. Message queues like RabbitMQ provide a buffer.

## Patterns of Messaging

- **Pub/Sub**: One-to-many communication.
- **Work Queues**: Distributing tasks among multiple workers.
- **Routing**: Sending messages to specific consumers based on criteria.

## Implementation Best Practices

Always ensure your consumers are idempotent...
