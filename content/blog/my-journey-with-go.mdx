## Why Go?

After years of working with Python and Node.js, I started noticing bottlenecks when dealing with highly concurrent tasks. This led me to explore Go (Golang).

## What I Love About Go

1. **Concurrency**: Goroutines are incredibly lightweight.
2. **Static Typing**: Caught so many bugs at compile-time.
3. **Simplicity**: The language is minimal and easy to learn.

## The Learning Curve

Coming from dynamic languages, the strictness of Go was a bit of a shock initially...
