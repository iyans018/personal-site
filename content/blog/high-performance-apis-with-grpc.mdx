## Beyond REST

While REST is great for public APIs, internal communication often requires more speed and stricter contracts. This is where gRPC shines.

## Benefits of gRPC

- **Protocol Buffers**: Faster serialization than JSON.
- **HTTP/2**: Multiplexing and server push.
- **Strong Typing**: Automatic code generation for various languages.

## When to Use gRPC
