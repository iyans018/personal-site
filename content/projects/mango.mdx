## The Challenge

As the central HRIS for Telkomsigma, Mango needed to bridge the gap between employee self-service and corporate data integrity. The primary challenge was the launch of the **ESS (Employee Self Service)** application, which required a robust backend module within Mango for Human Capital (HC) officers to review and approve data changes.

Technically, this was complex because:
- **Heterogeneous Data Categories**: Each request (from personal info to medical records) had unique validation rules and impact levels.
- **Complex Data Mapping**: A single approval category often didn't align 1-to-1 with database tables; approving one request could trigger updates across multiple Oracle tables.
- **Verification Requirements**: HC required a way to verify physical documents (IDs, Certificates) uploaded by employees before granting approval.

## The Solution

I architected and developed the approval module in Mango, focusing on building a scalable foundation that could handle various types of employee requests with high data integrity.

- **Unified Logic Handler (Strategy Pattern)**: Instead of writing redundant code for each category, I engineered a polymorphic handler using abstract functions. This provided a consistent interface for the approval API while allowing each category (Basic Info, Education, Medical, etc.) to implement its own unique update logic and validation.
- **Automated Workflow & Monitoring**: Developed a comprehensive summary dashboard for HC. This allowed for real-time tracking of pending transactions categorized by urgency and request type, ensuring no request was left unreviewed.
- **Seamless MS Graph Integration**: Integrated Mango with **MS Graph API** to handle document management. Uploaded verification files from ESS are automatically routed through Mango, verified, and stored securely in **SharePoint**, ensuring the system remains compliant with enterprise document storage policies.
- **Atomic Multi-Table Updates**: Implemented robust transaction handling to manage complex 1-to-many table mappings. This ensured that if a request impacted multiple tables, the update would either succeed completely or roll back, preventing data inconsistency.

```python
# Conceptual Implementation of the Unified Request Handler
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseUpdateHandler(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def validate(self, request_data):
        """Validate category-specific data"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def apply_update(self, request_data):
        """Logic to update one or multiple Oracle tables"""
        pass

class EducationUpdateHandler(BaseUpdateHandler):
    def validate(self, request_data):
        # Specific validation for education documents
        return True

    def apply_update(self, request_data):
        # Updates 'EMP_EDUCATION' and 'EMP_HISTORY' tables
        # Also triggers SharePoint upload via MS Graph
        pass

# Factory to route the request to the correct handler
class HandlerFactory:
    _handlers = {
        'EDUCATION': EducationUpdateHandler(),
        # Other categories...
    }
    
    @classmethod
    def get_handler(cls, category):
        return cls._handlers.get(category)
