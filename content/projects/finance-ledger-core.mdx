## The Challenge

Building a reliable and scalable matching engine for a new cryptocurrency exchange. The system needed to handle high concurrency and ensure atomic transactions without data loss.

## System Architecture

We adopted a microservices architecture using **Go** for high throughput.

- **Matching Engine**: In-memory order book for sub-millisecond matching.
- **Order Service**: Handles validations and persistence.
- **Wallet Service**: Manages hot/cold wallet transactions.

## Technical Implementation

We used **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous communication between services to decouple the matching engine from the persistence layer.

```go
func (m *MatchingEngine) ProcessOrder(order *Order) {
    // Matching logic
}
```

## The Impact

- Successfully handled **10,000 transactions per second** during load testing.
- Maintained **99.99% availability** during the launch week.
- Reduced order processing latency to **under 10ms**.
