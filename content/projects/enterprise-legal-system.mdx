## The Challenge

The client was struggling with a decade-old monolithic application that was slow, hard to maintain, and lacked modern security features. The goal was to modernize the backend while ensuring zero downtime for ongoing legal operations.

## System Architecture

We transitioned from a monolithic SOAP-based architecture to a modular **REST/GraphQL** API using **Node.js**.

- **API Gateway**: Unified entry point for all client applications.
- **Workflow Engine**: Custom engine to handle complex approval chains.
- **Document Service**: Secure storage and retrieval of sensitive legal documents.

## Technical Implementation

We implemented **Redis** caching to speed up frequent lookups and utilized **Docker** for consistent deployment environments.

```javascript
const resolveWorkflow = async (workflowId) => {
    const cached = await redis.get(`workflow:${workflowId}`);
    if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
    // ... fetch and cache logic
}
```

## The Impact

- Reduced document retrieval time by **60%**.
- Achieved a **smooth migration** with zero operational downtime.
- Improved developer productivity by **30%** with better tooling.
