## The Challenge

The legal contract approval process at Telkomsigma was heavily reliant on manual paperwork and fragmented email chains. This caused significant delays, increased the risk of lost documents, and made it difficult for stakeholders to track the status of critical contracts.

## The Solution

We built a robust, enterprise-grade system to digitize the entire lifecycle of a legal contract—from drafting and internal review to final approval and archival.

- **Workflow Engine**: Custom-built logic handling complex multi-tier approval hierarchies.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Used **Celery** and **RabbitMQ** to handle resource-intensive tasks like PDF generation and email notifications without blocking the user interface.
- **Document Integration**: Seamless connection with **Microsoft SharePoint** via REST APIs for centralized, secure storage of all contract files.

## Technical Implementation

Optimizing database performance was critical given the complexity of the contract relationships.

- **Query Optimization**: Refactored complex SQL joins and added strategic indexing in **Oracle SQL**, resulting in a significant performance boost.
- **Micro-integration**: Designed a resilient integration layer for SharePoint to ensure file consistency across systems.

```python
# Sample of Asynchronous Approval Processing
@shared_task
def process_contract_approval(contract_id, user_id):
    contract = Contract.objects.get(id=contract_id)
    # Perform expensive validations and state transitions
    contract.finalize_status()
    # Sync with SharePoint
    sync_to_sharepoint.delay(contract_id)
```

## The Impact

- **50% Reduction** in the total time required for a contract to move from draft to fully approved.
- **Unified Repository**: Centralized all legal documents into SharePoint, eliminating file duplication.
- **Auditability**: Provided a clear, digital audit trail for every contract action, ensuring compliance with enterprise standards.
