## The Challenge

E-commerce platforms often become rigid as they grow. ModuShop needed a backend that allowed third-party developers to easily build plugins without modifying the core codebase.

## System Architecture

We built a core platform using **Django** with a robust event-hook system.

- **Core API**: Handles products, orders, and users.
- **Plugin Engine**: Allows dynamic loading of extensions.
- **Search Service**: Powered by **Elasticsearch** for faceted search.

## Technical Implementation

**Celery** was used for background tasks like sending emails and processing payments to keep the main thread responsive.

```python
@shared_task
def process_order_payment(order_id):
    order = Order.objects.get(id=order_id)
    # ... payment processing logic
```

## The Impact

- Enabled a marketplace of **50+ plugins** within 3 months.
- Improved search relevance, leading to a **2x increase in conversion**.
- API response times stabilized under **500ms** even during peak traffic.
