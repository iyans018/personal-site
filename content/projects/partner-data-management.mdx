## The Challenge

Telkomsigma struggled with fragmented partner data spread across multiple legacy systems and departments. This led to data duplication, inconsistent sales reporting, and operational inefficiencies for the sales teams.

## System Architecture

We designed a centralized management system that acts as the single source of truth for all partner-related information.

- **Centralized Registry**: Unified database schema to store diverse partner attributes.
- **RESTful Gateway**: Secure APIs providing CRUD operations and search capabilities for other internal applications.
- **Modular Service Layer**: Business logic separated from data access to allow for scalable future integrations.

## Technical Implementation

Used **Node.js** and **Express** for the core API, integrated with a legacy **Oracle SQL** database. We focused on building a robust service layer that could handle complex data validation rules.

```javascript
const syncPartnerData = async (partnerId, updates) => {
    // 1. Validate incoming data
    // 2. Transact with OracleDB
    // 3. Notify downstream services via Webhooks
}
```

## The Impact

- **30% Increase** in sales team productivity by reducing time spent on manual data verification.
- **Eliminated** cross-departmental data duplication.
- **Improved** reporting accuracy for high-level management decision-making.
