## The Challenge

Following the initial phase of the PRM (Partner and Resource Management) system, the **Inbound & Outbound Procurement (IOP)** team required deeper functional capabilities. The existing system lacked the necessary data depth to evaluate vendor performance, track historical pricing, and visualize procurement trends, which are critical for strategic decision-making and vendor accountability.

## The Solution

As a Backend Developer within an agile team, I collaborated closely with Business Process Owners (BPO) and IT System Analysts (ITSA) to translate complex business requirements into scalable technical solutions. We followed an iterative development process to ensure the enhancements precisely met the IOP team's operational needs.

- **Dynamic Vendor Scoring**: I implemented the backend logic for a new scoring module. This feature evaluates vendors based on their historical performance data stored in the **Procurement List**, providing the IOP team with objective metrics for vendor selection.
- **Procurement & Price Intelligence**: 
    - **Procurement List**: Engineered a comprehensive repository for Purchase Order (PO) history, including detailed line-item tracking and scoring metrics.
    - **Price List**: Developed a module to track and display vendor pricing history alongside PO records, ensuring transparency in procurement costs over time.
- **Data-Driven Dashboard**: Built the backend APIs to support a new summary dashboard, providing real-time visualizations (charts and grids) of vendor transactions and procurement statuses.
- **Legacy System Integration**: Successfully expanded the existing **Django** and **Oracle** backend while maintaining compatibility with the **Vue 2** frontend, ensuring a seamless transition and zero downtime for the existing modules.

```python
# Backend Logic for Aggregating Vendor Performance Metrics
class VendorPerformanceService:
    @staticmethod
    def get_scoring_data(vendor_id):
        # Fetching historical PO data from Oracle DB
        po_history = ProcurementList.objects.filter(vendor_id=vendor_id)
        
        # Complex aggregation for scoring based on procurement frequency and value
        summary = {
            'total_po': po_history.count(),
            'total_value': sum(po.total_amount for po in po_history),
            'last_score': po_history.latest('created_at').score if po_history.exists() else 0
        }
        return summary
