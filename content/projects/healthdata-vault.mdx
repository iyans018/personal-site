## The Challenge

Handling sensitive patient data requires strict adherence to regulations like HIPAA. The client needed a secure vault that ensured data privacy at rest and in transit.

## System Architecture

We chose **Rust** for its memory safety and performance guarantees.

- **Vault Service**: Manages encryption keys securely.
- **Audit Service**: Immutable logs for every data access.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with strict granularity.

## Technical Implementation

End-to-end encryption was implemented where the server never sees the plaintext data.

```rust
fn encrypt_record(data: &[u8], key: &Key) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Error> {
    // AES-GCM encryption logic
}
```

## The Impact

- Fully **HIPAA compliant** auditing and storage.
- **Zero data breaches** in penetration testing.
- Faster compliance audits due to automated reporting.
