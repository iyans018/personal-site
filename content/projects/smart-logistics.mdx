## The Challenge

Tracking thousands of delivery vehicles in real-time and optimizing their routes to save fuel and time was the primary objective.

## System Architecture

We utilized **Kafka** to ingest high-frequency GPS data streams.

- **Ingestion Service**: Handles high-throughput GPS pings.
- **Optimization Engine**: Calculates best routes dynamically.
- **Driver App**: Built with React Native for cross-platform support.

## Technical Implementation

**WebSocket** connections provided live updates to the dashboard.

```go
func (h *Hub) Run() {
    for {
        select {
        case message := <-h.broadcast:
            // Broadcast location updates to clients
        }
    }
}
```

## The Impact

- **20% reduction in fuel costs** due to optimized routing.
- Scaled effortlessly to support **50,000+ active devices**.
- Improved delivery time estimates accuracy by **40%**.
