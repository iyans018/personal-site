## The Challenge

Telkomsigma needed a unified system to manage diverse contract categories—Sales, Procurement, and Partnership—each with distinct approval logic. The existing manual processes were opaque, making it difficult to track a contract's position or a Legal Officer's workload. Additionally, the development unit required a more robust, scalable backend structure to avoid technical debt in long-term enterprise projects.

## The Solution

Working within an iterative collaborative framework involving **Business Process Owners (BPO)** for requirements and **IT System Analysts (ITSA)** for system design, I executed the backend development of Digipactum from scratch.

- **Standardized Layered Architecture**: I designed and implemented a backend structure based on a clean layered architecture (Separating Service, Repository, and Controller logic). This design was so effective in terms of maintainability and testability that it was adopted as the official **Project Structure Standard** for all Backend development within the unit.
- **Dynamic Workflow Engine**: To handle varying business processes for Sales or Procurement contracts, I built a configurable engine. This allows administrators to define and adjust approval flows through the system UI, enabling the business to adapt to process changes without requiring new code deployments.
- **SharePoint Online Integration**: Developed a seamless document generation flow. The system duplicates existing legal templates in **Microsoft SharePoint** and allows users to perform **online editing** directly within the web app, ensuring all versions are centralized and securely stored.
- **AI-Driven Executive Summaries**: Integrated AI capabilities to parse complex legal documents. The system provides automated summary suggestions, which are then used to populate Executive Summary documents, significantly speeding up the review phase.
- **Operational Visibility (Dashboard & My Basket)**: 
    - **Dashboard**: Created a real-time monitoring hub to track contract statuses and Legal Officer workloads.
    - **My Basket**: Implemented a personalized task management feature, allowing users to instantly identify and execute pending actions (Approve/Reject) on contracts assigned to them.

```python
# Implementation of the Layered Architecture Pattern (Service Layer)
class ContractApprovalService:
    def __init__(self, repository: ContractRepository, workflow_engine: DynamicWorkflowEngine):
        self.repo = repository
        self.engine = workflow_engine

    def process_transition(self, contract_id, action, user_id):
        # Business logic separated from the View/Controller
        contract = self.repo.get_for_update(contract_id)
        next_step = self.engine.get_next_step(contract.category, current_step=contract.step, action=action)
        
        # Syncing with SharePoint for document finalization
        if next_step.is_final:
            sharepoint_service.lock_document(contract.document_id)
            
        return self.repo.update_status(contract_id, next_step)
