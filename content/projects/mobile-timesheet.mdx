## The Challenge

Telkomsigma's internal leave and activity tracking system required manual intervention for generating daily reports and synchronizing data between the mobile application and the core enterprise databases. This was time-consuming and prone to human error.

## The Solution

I designed and implemented a series of **Apache Airflow DAGs** (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to fully automate the data pipeline and reporting workflows.

- **Automated Sync**: Background tasks that pull activity logs from the mobile database and push them to the central HR systems.
- **Dynamic Reporting**: Daily automated generation of PDF/Excel reports sent directly to department heads.
- **Monitoring**: Implemented robust error handling and alerting via Slack/Email if a sync task fails.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation focused on clean, idempotent Airflow tasks using Python.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator

def sync_timesheet_data():
    # Logic to fetch from mobile API and push to HRDB
    pass

with DAG('timesheet_sync_v2', schedule_interval='@daily') as dag:
    task_sync = PythonOperator(
        task_id='sync_data',
        python_callable=sync_timesheet_data
    )
```

## The Impact

- **100% Automation** of the reporting process, saving hours of manual work every week.
- **Improved Data Accuracy**: Real-time synchronization ensured that leave balances and activity logs were always up-to-date across all platforms.
- **Reliability**: The system's self-healing nature through Airflow retries significantly reduced downtime.
